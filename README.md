This repo consists of C programming exercises related to operating
systems.

In particular, system calls were new to me, and these exercises
feature ways to capture a common one, namely SIGINT (triggered by
CTRL+C on Linux, from the Shell), and run given actions upon capture,
via 'signal handlers'.
